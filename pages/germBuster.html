        <h3>Project Description</h3>
        <p>Germ Buster is a short, simple, educational game for kids. The player will control the little kid inside the world of disease. The kid must fight the disease to survive. My team goal is to provide a fun game that will help kids learn more about germs and personal hygiene.</p>
        <h3>Project Timeline</h3>
        <h4>Game Pitch</h4>
        <p>My team brainstormed ideas about what kind of game we should make. We thought it would be great to make an educational game with an entertaining approach. Then, we decided that our target audience will be kids. We started to brainstorm ideas that would benefit children. That is how Germ Buster was born.</p>
        <h4>Prototype Time</h4>
        <p>We started with basic shapes as a placeholder, such as squares for the players and circles for the enemies. I worked on the movement and effect of the enemies. I also helped my team with art. Other members focused on art, player movement, and head-up display (HUD). We had a weekly meeting to keep track of what we were doing and supported each other when needed.</p>
        <h4>Delivery</h4>
        <p>As we were almost done with the project, we worked together to add instructions and add short descriptions of the germs. We also applied art to make it look polished. Once we got it done within time limit, we decided to go out to eat together to celebrate our project.</p>
        <h4>Delivery</h4>
        <p>Germ Buster was a fun project to work together on as a team and something that I will keep looking back on. My team had cool ideas to add, but we could not add more features due to the time limit we were given. It was fantastic to work together and learn each others personalities. The result of the project did not only help me in programming, but also helped me understand how to plan out the timeline better and give constructive feedback. I will have no problem working with Erick Sauri and Bennoni Thomas again in the future.</p>
