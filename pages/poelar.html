        <h3>Project Description</h3>
        <p>Poelar is a team project that Katelyn Biniak and I worked on together to understand how iOS8 work. We decided to go for a word magnet app. With this app, people can change the font size, share on social media, change the word categories, and moving words to create poetry. The user can also change the background image using the photo from their phone.</p>
        <h3>Project Timeline</h3>
        <h4>Research</h4>
        <p>We both started with our research by downloading several applications that is similar to word magnet. After the research, we make a list of what things they have in common and what makes them stand out such as word categories and being able to move the word, and resizing the word. Before we started coding, my partner and I wanted to make a sketch of what our app will look like so that way we will know what things need to be included in the program such as displaying the word, share to media, font-size, background, and select word categories. Once we decided what we needed, we started doing coding.</p>
        <h4>Coding Time</h4>
        <p>We did come across some problems. For example, we were struggling on resetting the word lists. For some reason, the word lists kept adding itself when the word categories change. We were puzzled for a long time. We realized we forgot our rookie mistake. We just needed to reset the array list for the word lists. Other examples of problems we faced were struggling sharing the word array list’s X and Y position to other files. We decided to make a “share manager.” It was basically a share file where it can share info to another file.</p>
        <h4>Conclusion</h4>
        <p>It is a fun project to learn about iOS8. My partner and I learned many things such as color, story board, map, pause when running in background, save, load, and many other basic stuff.</p>
