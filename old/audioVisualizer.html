    <h3>Project Description</h3>
    <p>The audio visualizer is a interactive application. It was basically showing the sound wave base on the sound itself. This allow the user to interactive by changing the color on canvas. They also can add or remove the different kind of ready made frequency. It also include three songs which are New Adventure Theme, Peanuts Theme, and The Picard Song. </p>
    <h3>Project Timeline</h3>
    <h4>Research</h4>
    <p>This is a solo project. I admit that I dont know how the sound wave was created. So, I did google it across internet to understand the frequence, pitch, and the loudness. From the research, I learned interesting stuffs. </p>
    <h4>Prototype Time</h4>
    <p>We decide start building prototype. We start with basic shape as a placeholder such as square for the player and circle for the enemies. I was working on the movement and effect of the enemy. I also help my team with art. Other member forcus on art, player movement, and hud. We had a weekly meeting to keep track of what we are doing and support each other in any way if need.</p>
    <h4>Delivery</h4>
    <p>As we are almost done with the project, we work together to add intruction and add short describtion of the germ. We also applied art to make it look polished. Once we got it done within time limit, we decided to go out to eat together to leave a print of happy ending of our project. </p>
    <h4>Conclusion</h4>
    <p>Germ Buster was a fun project to work as a team and something that I will keep looking back again. My team did have a lot of cool idea to add, but we could not add more feature due to the time limit we were given. It was a fantastic to work together and learn each other personality. The result of the project does not only help me in programming, it help me understand how to plan out the timeline better and giving constructive feedback so that way they will improve. I will have no problem working with Erick Sauri and Bennoni Thomas since we did a great job.</p>
