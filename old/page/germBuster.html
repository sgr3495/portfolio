    <h3>Project Description</h3>
    <p>Germ Buster is a short simple education game for kid. The player will
      control the little kid inside the world of disease. The kid must fight the
      disease to survive. My team goal was to provide fun game that will help a
      kid learn more about germs and personal hygiene.</p>
    <h3>Project Timeline</h3>
    <h4>Game Pitch</h4>
    <p>My team start to brainstorming ideas about what kind of game we should make. We thought it will be great to make a game with an education and entertainment approach. Then, we decide that our target audience will be for kids. We start to brainstorm couple of idea that will benefit for children. That is how Germ Buster was born.</p>
    <h4>Prototype Time</h4>
    <p>We decide start building prototype. We start with basic shape as a placeholder such as square for the player and circle for the enemies. I was working on the movement and effect of the enemy. I also help my team with art. Other member forcus on art, player movement, and hud. We had a weekly meeting to keep track of what we are doing and support each other in any way if need.</p>
    <h4>Delivery</h4>
    <p>As we are almost done with the project, we work together to add intruction and add short describtion of the germ. We also applied art to make it look polished. Once we got it done within time limit, we decided to go out to eat together to leave a print of happy ending of our project. </p>
    <h4>Conclusion</h4>
    <p>Germ Buster was a fun project to work as a team and something that I will keep looking back again. My team did have a lot of cool idea to add, but we could not add more feature due to the time limit we were given. It was a fantastic to work together and learn each other personality. The result of the project does not only help me in programming, it help me understand how to plan out the timeline better and giving constructive feedback so that way they will improve. I will have no problem working with Erick Sauri and Bennoni Thomas since we did a great job.</p>
