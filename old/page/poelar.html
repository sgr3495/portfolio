        <h3>Project Description</h3>
        <p>Poelar is a team project that Katelyn Biniak and I work together to understand how iOS8 work. We decide to go for word magnet app. With this app, people can change the font size, share to social media, change the word categorizes, moving word to create poetry. User can also change the background image using the photo from their phone. </p>
        <h3>Project Timeline</h3>
        <h4>Research</h4>
        <p>We both start with research by downloading various of app that is similar to word magnet. After the research, we make a list what thing they have it in common and what make them stand out such as word categories and being able to move the word, and resize the word.Before we starting coding, my partner and I want to make a sketch of what our app will look like so that way we will know what thing need to be include in program such as display the word, share to media, font-size, background, and select word categories. Once we decide what we need, we started doing coding. </p>
        <h4>Coding Time</h4>
        <p> We did come across some problems. For example, we were struggle on resetting the word lists. For some reason, the word lists keep adding itself when the word categories change. We were puzzle for a long time. We realized we forgot our rookie mistake. We just need to reset the array list for the word lists. Other example problem we face, we were struggling sharing the word array list’s X and Y position to other file. We decide to make a “share manager.” It is basically a share file where it can share info to other file. </p>
        <h4>Conclusion</h4>
        <p>It is a fun project to learn about iOS8. My partner and I learned many things such as color, story board, map, pause when running in background, save, load, and many other basic stuff.</p>
